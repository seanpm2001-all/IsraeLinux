# Excerpt from SeansLifeArchive/DailyArticles/2021February6th/ODT

I came up with a new idea tonight, it comes from the use of puns and portmanteaus, my two favorite ways of naming projects, and sometimes the name alone is the starter basis of the project. This time it was a portmanteau. I came up with the idea of IsraeLinux. It is a Linux distribution that is now being planned by me that is designed for use by the State of Israel, Synagogues, Religious study, and virtual machine play. In terms of features, it is pretty close to Ubuntu Satanic Edition or Hannah Montana Linux, being that it doesn’t add too much in terms of functionality, and mostly just includes multimedia content and themes. However, I plan to make it somewhat unique in its configuration, such as a fancy book reader. The only real problem with the idea is that I am not a jew, and I don’t know if it is OK for a non-jew to host such a valuable Jewish project. I think it is OK, but it might be seen the wrong way by some. I still plan to move forward with the idea after I get more caught up. I have considerations for holocaust and other Jewish Genocide memorials, but I don’t know how to include them without controversy.

I included this excerpt, as it describes the project pretty well in its current state.
